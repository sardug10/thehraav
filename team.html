            &quot; It is okay to have depression, it is okay to have anxiety and it is okay to have an 
            adjustment disorder. We need to improve the conversation. We all have mental health in
             the same way we all have physical health. Mental health includes our emotional, 
             psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
             It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. 
             Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. 
             Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  
             Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, 
             particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Similarly, 
             the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness. 
             Thehraav works to make everyone happy just like their Instagram pictures. 
             And we are working with youth to make it happen in real &quot;

            &quot; Be brave enough to take of the masks you were out on social platforms and let them get to know who you are underneath. Be vulnerable enough to accept your flaws and know that they are what make you beautiful; they are what make you real. Be confident enough to accept and cherish your strength. Don't minimize them or hide them.... They are your beautiful gifts to share with the world. 
            Be brave enough to say, you know what, all of this is who I am. I make so many mistakes. I am messy, I am stressed. But.... I am doing my level best . And I am so proud of that . I am proud of who I am & I will not change for the world.

            &quot; Showing individual respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully coping with the illness of mental health.Having people see you as an individual and not as your illness can make the biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental health. &quot;

            &quot; Suffering from depression can cause people to feel alone, unwanted, unloved, and defeated. What we need is to talk about it be. 
            It's nothing to be embarrassed about or to hide. Our mental health affects us a lot in every way, the way we understand things, the way we look at people, how we act in various situations and Specially how we look at ourselves, what we think about us.
            We all are having mental health issues in one way or another, some people deal with it while some of us are unable to deal with it.
            Remember that everything that happens to you will ultimately make you stronger. When you get through this, and I know you will, you'll have gained strength and wisdom. It might not make much sense today, but it will later. Just love yourself and talk about it.
            Here at Thehraav we are working to make everyone happy just like their Instagram pictures with youth to make it happen in real. We want you to be happy from within As Happy Eyes speak more than happy profiles.

            &quot; Mental stress, these are just two words for some people but I think in today's world everyone has some kind of stress in their lives. Children have pressure of their studies, Teens are stressed for their careers, Adults for jobs and family, and old ones for their health and children. Many People think it's nothing and ignores it but actually it kills your mind and thinking power. Stress leads to problems like anxiety, depression etc. 
            Many of us don't share our problems and the things we have in our mind which are killing out mental peace just because what others will think or if we tell them they will not understand and rather make fun but actually this is the problem, if you will not share your issues with your close ones or with whom you trust then these thoughts and overthinking will keep building up and eventually lead to depression, anxiety etc like problems.
            And that's why we sometimes ignores those little stress busters or things which make us happy and instead think about the problems we had, have or can have.
            So I feel if someone is stressed, depressed,or overthinks more, they should do positive things and divert their minds towards the things which are good un their lives, which makes them happy. You can share your problems with your close ones or family. Keeping things to yourself will not help you everytime.
            Always try to find happiness in your life and deal with your problems and the end result will be good.
            As it is said "There's always a happy ending, if it's not then it's not the end".
