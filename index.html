          ठहRaaV foundation is a registered Non-profit organization committed to
          work for better mental health of people. It is an attempt to create a
          mentally healthy and stable nation. The main objective of ठहRaaV is to
          remove the stigma associated with mental health that has been
          escalated deep into the society. We at ठहRaaV believe that the lack of
          awareness and understanding among people is one of the major reasons
          due to which a larger portion of people dealing with mental illness
          remain unheard.

            In India there is a stigma attached with mental health. A majority of
            people, who are not factually aware or concerned, end up attaching
            unreasonable theories with people facing mental health issues. This
            further makes it difficult for people who are actually dealing with
            mental illness to come out and talk about it which ultimately worsens
            the case.
            <br><br>
            NGO ठहRaaV aims at removing this stigma and helping those who
            are facing such mental health issues. Our drivers are the ideals of
            patience, compassion and comprehension. With these we make an
            attempt to bring people out of their dark world to see the bright and
            colorful side of the world which awaits them.
            <br><br>
            We aim at building a society incorporated with a little more kindness,
            love, compassion and understanding towards each other.

            COVID-19 posed an extraordinary challenge to the world. The main
            psychological impact till date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety.
            Quarantine and its effects on many people's usual activities are quite
            evident. The lockdown has caused serious changes in the routines or
            livelihoods of a vast majority of people especially in terms of increased
            levels of loneliness, depression, alcohol and drug consumption, and
            self-harm or suicidal behavior.<br><br>
            ठहraav, being a savior to all those who are fighting with stress,
            anxiety and other mental health issues organized few online
            sessions for its members and outsiders free of cost to help them
