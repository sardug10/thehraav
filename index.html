          ठहRaaV foundation is a registered Non-profit organization committed to
          work for better mental health of people. It is an attempt to create a
          mentally healthy and stable nation. The main objective of ठहRaaV is to
          remove the stigma associated with mental health that has been
          escalated deep into the society. We at ठहRaaV believe that the lack of
          awareness and understanding among people is one of the major reasons
          due to which a larger portion of people dealing with mental illness
          remain unheard.

          We all are facing a very hard time right now. Everyone is aware of everything. This pandemic makes us
          realize that nature is the supreme power and we all are very small in front of it. There was a time when
          we were harming the nature and now it’s pay back time. Nature is taking its revenge. It’s high time for
          us to understand the value of nature and life.<br><br>
          Following the lockdown and spread of Covid, life seems to have come to an unwanted and disturbing
          standstill. But we believe, this too shall pass. We don’t need to stress ourselves, rather take time to
          focus on the positive aspects. Our government is working in this direction and eventually we all are also
          taking proper safety measures. So be cautious but not scared or stressed. Look at the brighter side and
          spend a lot of time with your families, know yourself, explore things you love and do whatever you find
          interesting. It’s even alright if you don’t feel like doing anything, at times, because each one needs a
          break, and it’s absolutely acceptable.<br><br>
          So just to a reminder, we at THERAAV are there for you. We are relentlessly working towards our aim to
          spread mental health awareness in the society and make people as happy as there pictures. We are just
          one call away, even in these disturbing times. You can contact us whenever you feel the need for
          someone to hear, whenever you’re stressed or depressed. You can also follow us on instagram,
          facebook and twitter to get some health tips to stay away from stress, anxiety, depression and all. You
          can also participate in our competitions to learn and grow. We also host time to time live sessions with
          eminent counsellors which would also help you to see the world with different perspective.<br>
          Remember, we are always there for you.

            In India there is a stigma attached with mental health. A majority of
            people, who are not factually aware or concerned, end up attaching
            unreasonable theories with people facing mental health issues. This
            further makes it difficult for people who are actually dealing with
            mental illness to come out and talk about it which ultimately worsens
            the case.
            <br><br>
            NGO ठहRaaV aims at removing this stigma and helping those who
            are facing such mental health issues. Our drivers are the ideals of
            patience, compassion and comprehension. With these we make an
            attempt to bring people out of their dark world to see the bright and
            colorful side of the world which awaits them.
            <br><br>
            We aim at building a society incorporated with a little more kindness,
            love, compassion and understanding towards each other.

            COVID-19 posed an extraordinary challenge to the world. The main
            psychological impact till date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety.
            Quarantine and its effects on many people's usual activities are quite
            evident. The lockdown has caused serious changes in the routines or
            livelihoods of a vast majority of people especially in terms of increased
            levels of loneliness, depression, alcohol and drug consumption, and
            self-harm or suicidal behavior.<br><br>
            ठहraav, being a savior to all those who are fighting with stress,
            anxiety and other mental health issues organized few online
            sessions for its members and outsiders free of cost to help them
